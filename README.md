# Snake Game in Python using Pygame

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Pygame library in Python. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, attempting to eat randomly generated food to grow in length. The player can control the snake's direction with arrow keys. The game ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries or itself.

## Features:
- Snake movement and growth mechanics.
- Randomly generated food for the snake to eat.
- Game over screen with the option to restart or quit.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## How to Play:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Pygame library using `pip install pygame`.
3. Run the `snake_game.py` script.
4. Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
5. Try to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the screen boundaries or yourself.
6. Upon game over, press 'R' to restart or 'Q' to quit.

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from this simple Snake Game implementation. Have fun coding!
